Playing w/ a Group
--------------------------------------
/============================/
PwG_01
Detail
In a 25x30 yard grid, 2 teams play to 2 neutral targets (defend and attack the same target players). Getting it from target player to target player = 1 point. 
Progressions
Limit touches as a restriction. 
Adaptations
Make the playing space bigger or smaller depending on number of players.

/============================/
PwG_02
Detail
In a 20x30 yard field, play 3v3+1 to two mini goals.
Progressions
N/A
Adaptations
If you have two games going at once, switch teams around and make a tournament.


/============================/
PwG_03
Detail
Set up a grid, 30’x20’. Ensure each team has 2 end players on either side of the goal, with 3 players inside the middle grid. Ball starts with the coach to either team. To score a point, you must find an end player first. Change end players every 2 minutes. Progressions
Make players complete a certain number of passes before they can score a goal.
Adaptations
Depending on numbers, either add a neutral or play 4v4 in the middle.


/============================/
PwG_04
Detail
Set up 2 grids 15’x20’ with a 5’ channel in between. 1 team of 5 starts in 1 grid. To start, the coach plays the ball in to the attacking team on one side. Once the ball enters the grid, 2 red players from the other side press to win the ball back. To score a point, the blue team must connect 8 passes. If red wins the ball back, they must pass the ball back across the middle channel. Once the ball travels back across the middle channel, the red team is now looking to keep possession, blue sends 2 to defend. Every player should take a turn to defend. If ball goes out of bounds, the coach plays the ball back in.
Progressions
N/A
Adaptations
If two defenders is too difficult, start with just one player defending.


/============================/
PwG_05
Detail
Set up cones 20’ apart, as shown in photo. 2 teams of 5. 4 players line up on the outside of the square as target players. 3 players from each team start inside the square. The objective for each team is to connect 10 passes. Teams can use any of the target players on the outside of the grid. If ball goes out of the grid off of one team, coach plays new ball in to the other team. Switch outside players every 3 minutes.
Progressions
Teams play one direction to their targets. Set up target players from one team across the grid from each other. Teams score a point when they connect from one side of the grid to the other. 
Adaptations
If there are more than 10 players, make the grid bigger and have it 4v4 in the inside.


/============================/
PwG_06
Detail
Make a 20x30 yard grid. 2 goals (or 1 goal and 2 flags) will need to be placed to make a mini field (see picture). Players will need to be divided into 3 equal teams. Place cones down to mark out the field, on 3 of the 4 middle cones place a ball on top (see picture). If a player kicks the ball out of play (missed shot/missed pass) that they are playing with that player must run to get that ball and place it back on top of one of the middle cones. While this is happening the other team will get a ball off the other cones and continue to play (the other team will be playing a player short until their player gets back in the game).  If a goal is scored, the team that scores stays in and the team that got scored on switches with the team on the side line.
Progressions
N/A
Adaptations
Make the field bigger if you have more players.

/============================/
PwG_07
Detail
Field size should be approx. 25x25.
First, players are divided into two equal teams. One team starts in the middle of the grid. The other team that isn’t in the middle is numbered 1- (how many players you have). The coach passes the ball into the middle and the player numbered #1 goes in and chases. If the team in the middle makes 5 consecutive passes, #2 goes in and helps #1 chase. When the defenders win the ball or the ball goes out of bounds reset and the next defender goes in and chases. 
Progressions
Have defending players start on different areas around the box.
Adaptations
Make field bigger or smaller depending on number of players.
