  description: "Detail\r\nSee diagram for set up. All gates should be 3 yards wide
    and should be 15 yards apart from each other. Player in the middle will receive
    from one of the sides, receive with the inside of their back foot and then on
    their second touch play to the player at the top, who will receive with the outside
    of their foot, who will then play back to the line that the ball came from. Players
    follow their pass and then the next pass starts with the opposite line with the
    same sequence. \r\nProgressions\r\nSwitch the surface players will receive with.\r\nMake
    gates further apart.\r\nAdaptations\r\nN/A"
