    the first 5 minutes, players dribble in towards the middle pole, go to one side,
    and dribble in to the line across from them. Once players reach the middle of
    the grid, the other colours start from the opposite corners. Switch directions
    \ around the flag after 5 minutes.\r\nProgressions\r\nPlayers can then start adding
    in a move to get around the pole. \r\nAdaptations\r\nMake outside box bigger for
    older players.\r\n"
