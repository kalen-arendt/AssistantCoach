  description: "Detail\r\nIn a 15x25 yard area, set up 4 gates (one in each corner
    \u2013 yellow cones in diagram). Split the group into two and have them stand
    in the gates diagonal from each other. One player starts by running with the ball
    and then playing into the gate, as soon as the ball has gone through (or out of
    bounds), the player in the opposite line starts running with the ball, the player
    who just scored should go try to defend the gate. Switch sides that players start
    on half way through.\r\nProgressions\r\nHave a competition, whichever team scores
    10 goals first is the winner (every time a player successfully dribbles through
    a gate it counts as one goal).\r\nAdaptations\r\nMake gates wider for younger
    age groups. \r\n"
