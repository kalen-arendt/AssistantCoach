  description: "Detail\r\nIn a 22x40 yard space, cut the field in half. In each defending
    half, play 4v1 (plus a GK). These players must stay in their grid and score from
    their own half. Defending players on the other team can attempt to block. If the
    one attacking player wins the ball they can either pass it back into their defending
    half or try to score. Switch the one defending player in the attacking half every
    2 minutes. Keep score. \r\nProgressions\r\nN/A\r\nAdaptations\r\nAdd another defender
    into each half to apply more pressure.\r\n"
