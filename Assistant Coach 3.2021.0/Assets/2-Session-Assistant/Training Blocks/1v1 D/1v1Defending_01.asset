  description: "Detail\r\nIn a 8x15y grid, have players stand on opposite ends of
    the grid; one side will have the soccer balls (see picture). Player that starts
    with the ball passes it to the player on the other side of the grid. Then the
    2 players go 1v1 until the ball goes out or someone dribbles it past the end line.
    \r\nProgressions\r\nHave the player chip the ball into the air to the attacking
    player.\r\nAdd gates that players need to score on.\r\nAdaptations\r\nDepending
    on # of players you may need to make 2 grids.\r\n"
