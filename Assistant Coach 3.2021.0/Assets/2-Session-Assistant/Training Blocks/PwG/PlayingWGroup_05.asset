  description: "Detail\r\nSet up cones 20\u2019 apart, as shown in photo. 2 teams
    of 5. 4 players line up on the outside of the square as target players. 3 players
    from each team start inside the square. The objective for each team is to connect
    10 passes. Teams can use any of the target players on the outside of the grid.
    If ball goes out of the grid off of one team, coach plays new ball in to the other
    team. Switch outside players every 3 minutes.\r\nProgressions\r\nTeams play one
    direction to their targets. Set up target players from one team across the grid
    from each other. Teams score a point when they connect from one side of the grid
    to the other. \r\nAdaptations\r\nIf there are more than 10 players, make the grid
    bigger and have it 4v4 in the inside.\r\n"
