  description: "Detail\r\nFor the first 10 minutes players will work in their own
    space working on different Coerver skills (toe touches, foundation touches, combination,
    left foot triangles, right foot triangles and pull-stop \u2013 both directions).
    For the next ten minutes, players will line up behind cones as shown in picture
    and will dribble/perform different activities to the cone then turn right (switch
    to left half way through) and dribble to the next line, the next player in line
    can start when player gets to the end of the next line (4 players going at a time).
    Start with dribbling with right foot, then dribbling with left foot, then toe
    touches to the middle cone, foundation touches to the middle cone, pull stops
    to the middle cone.\r\nProgressions\r\nHave players dribble to the middle cone,
    do a Coerver activity and then dribble back. When they get back their partner
    goes (make this into a relay race).\r\nAdaptations\r\nN/A\r\n"
