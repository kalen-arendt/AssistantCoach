  description: "Detail\r\nField size = 10-12x10-12yds. 4-6players to a grid. Defender
    starts in the middle of the grid and tosses a ball for the attacking player to
    control, then must touch a cone before they can defend. If defender serves it
    out of bounds they redo it. Play to small goals.  Game restarts when the ball
    goes out of bounds.  Both players take a turn being the defender before you switch
    the pair in the middle.  \r\nCoaching pts: \r\n1. Watch the ball right into their
    foot\r\n2. Present the controlling surface then withdraw it to cushion the ball
    down.\r\n3. While ball is in the air attacker should find the location of the
    defender.\r\n4. 1st touch away from pressure.\r\n5. Face defender as quickly as
    possible.\r\nProgressions:\r\nThe better they get the higher the toss should go.
    \ \r\nAdaptations\r\nDefender must touch 1 of 2 cones on the attackers half.\r"
