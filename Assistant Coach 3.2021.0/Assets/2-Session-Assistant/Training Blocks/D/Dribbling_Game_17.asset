  description: "Detail\r\nIn a 12x30 yard space, players line up across from each
    other (see diagram). One line has balls, the other doesn\u2019t, player with the
    ball passes across and then that player tries to dribble through one of the gates.
    The player that passed the ball tries to defend. If the defender wins the ball
    they try to dribble through one of the gates. If ball goes out or goal is scored,
    players switch lines. Progressions\r\nIf players are doing well, let them score
    in the gate across from them for 2 points and the side goals for one point. \r\nAdaptations\r\nN/A"
