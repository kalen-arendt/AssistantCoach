  description: "Detail\r\nCones should be 20 yards apart. Start off by having one
    player on every cone (need a ball) and one player in the middle of every cone
    (see picture). Players on the cone need to have one yellow cone and one red cone
    in opposite hands. Player in the middle asks for the ball from one end, while
    this is happening, the player on the opposite end raises one of the cones. Before
    the player in the middle receives the ball they need to check their shoulder and
    see what cone is being held up (they should then yell out the colour). Player
    then receives the ball and with their first touch plays around that colour cone
    (see picture), and then passes it back to the player. Then the player in the middle
    will turn and do the same thing to the player on the opposite side. (Players will
    do this for 1 min then switch; each player should be in the middle twice).\r\nProgressions\r\nIf
    a red cone is held up, player in the middle bounces the ball back in one touch.
    If yellow is held up, player in the middle turns and plays out the other side.\r\nAdaptations\r\nIf
    there is a group of 4, have the players rotate.\r"
