  description: "Detail\r\nLadder spacing = 10x10. Players work in pairs. Both players
    start behind the line with one partner having the ball in their hands and the
    other ready to receive. Each time they are successful they move up a rung in the
    ladder. To get 1pt pairs must perform the skill 4 consecutive times (once in each
    rung of the ladder) alternating the server and the receiver. If they mess up they
    go back to the beginning and start over but they maintain their pts. Play until
    a pair gets the target number of pts for that skill. Ie; Kick, Head(receiver),
    Catch(server). Only 1 pair in a rung of the ladder at a time.\r\nCoaching pts:
    \r\n1. Strike ball with laces for service\r\n2. Be on toes so to adjust body position
    appropriately\r\n3. Judge the flight of the ball first then get body in line with
    the ball\r\n4. Square body to the target\r\n5. Present surface and cushion the
    ball\r\n6. Controlled ball should remain in front of the body\r\nProgressions:\r\n1.
    Bounce Kick-Catch, 2. Bounce Kick-Head-Catch, 3. Bounce Kick-Control-bounce kick-Catch,
    4. \r\n"
