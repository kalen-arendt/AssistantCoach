  description: "Detail\r\nSet up grid as shown (2, 10x20 yard end zones, and a 20x20
    central zone). Ball gets played into one of the end zone teams; the central team
    can send one player in to defend. The end zone team tries to get 3 passes, if
    they do they can play over (or drive a ball through) to the far team in the opposite
    end zone. The players in the central zone can try to intercept the ball. If the
    team successfully transfers the ball from one end zone to the other they get a
    point. If the defending team wins the ball back, or the ball goes out, the defending
    team switches with the team in the end zone. \r\nProgressions\r\nAdd a second
    defending player in to defend.\r\nAdaptations\r\nMake middle zone even bigger
    (or smaller) depending on age and ability.\r\n"
