  description: "Detail\r\nPlay 5v5 (or 4v4) in a 25x25 yard box. Have two target players
    in a 7x7 yard box 15 yards away from the 25x25 yard box (see diagram). Players
    in the central grid try to get the ball in the air to the player in the same colour
    as them in the target box. The player in the target box must control the ball
    in the air, inside the box for their team to get a point. If ball goes out of
    play, or point is scored, the coach will play another ball into the team that
    has not played it out. Switch target players every 2-3 minutes.\r\nProgressions\r\nN/A\r\nAdaptations\r\nN/A"
