  description: "Detail\r\nPlayers pick a partner and play in a 6x6 yard box. They
    strike the ball in the air and try to get the ball to land in the opposite 6x6
    (which is 20 yards away). If it enters the grid without a bounce, one of the players
    in that grid controls the ball for their teammate (in one touch \u2013 before
    the ball touches the ground) and that player knocks it back trying to get it into
    the 6x6. Game continues until the ball goes out, the team that doesn\u2019t get
    the ball into the opposite 6x6, gets a point (you don\u2019t want points). Play
    games of 4-5 minutes. Winning team moves right, losing team moves left (the right
    most field is where teams should try to get).\r\n\nPlace end zones further apart
    if 20 yards is becoming too easy.\r\n"
