  description: "Detail\r\nHave equal numbers behind each of the 4 cones. Players on
    cone \u20181\u2019 start by dribbling up to the two cones, performing a little
    faint, cutting inside then have a shot. They will then turn around, perform a
    give and go around the two cones with the player on cone \u20182\u2019 then take
    a shot. Cone \u20183\u2019 will also be a give and go before the shot, and cone
    \u20184\u2019 will just dribble up to the two cones, perform a faint, cut inside
    and shoot (with left foot). Have each player go through each line 3 times. If
    time permits go a 4th or 5th."
