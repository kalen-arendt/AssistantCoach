  description: "Detail\r\nActivity #1: Ball gets played from one line to another (see
    picture), as that pass happens, player on the base line in front of the cone that
    has been passed to sprints in between the flags, turns with the ball in one touch
    and shoots with their second touch. Player that made the first pass will stay
    in the same line to receive the next ball from the opposite line, player that
    made the pass into the shooting player will go behind the base line and player
    who took the shot will grab their ball in go to the back of the passing line.
    Activity #2: Starts the same as activity #1 but the opposite side player will
    run in between the poles to turn in one touch and shoot in their second touch
    (diagonal pass instead of straight pass). Rotation of players will be the same.
    \r\nProgressions\r\n(See above)\r\nAdaptations\r\nN/A\r\n"
