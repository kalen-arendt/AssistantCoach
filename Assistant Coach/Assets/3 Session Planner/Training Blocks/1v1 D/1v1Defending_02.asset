  description: "Detail\r\nExtend the 18y box to 25y. Place two small gates (in yellow)
    opposite from the full size goal. Have the defenders start by the net and pass
    the ball to the first attacker. The attacker tries to score in the big goal, if
    the defender wins the ball they try to dribble through one of the yellow gates.
    Players will switch roles after 5 minutes and teams should keep score.\r\n\nAdaptations\r\nIf
    attacking players are shooting right away, encourage them to dribble or extend
    the length of the field.\r\n"
