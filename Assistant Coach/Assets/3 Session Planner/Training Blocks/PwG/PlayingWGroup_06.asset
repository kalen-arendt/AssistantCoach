  description: "Detail\r\nMake a 20x30 yard grid. 2 goals (or 1 goal and 2 flags)
    will need to be placed to make a mini field (see picture). Players will need to
    be divided into 3 equal teams. Place cones down to mark out the field, on 3 of
    the 4 middle cones place a ball on top (see picture). If a player kicks the ball
    out of play (missed shot/missed pass) that they are playing with that player must
    run to get that ball and place it back on top of one of the middle cones. While
    this is happening the other team will get a ball off the other cones and continue
    to play (the other team will be playing a player short until their player gets
    back in the game).  If a goal is scored, the team that scores stays in and the
    team that got scored on switches with the team on the side line.\r\nProgressions\r\nN/A\r\nAdaptations\r\nMake
    the field bigger if you have more players.\r\n"
