  description: "Detail\r\nIn a 20x25 yard box place 3 cones beside each other at random
    (see picture). These cones act as a defender.  Players will dribble around the
    box and when reaching a row of cones will perform the desired move (inside cut,
    outside cut, step over). \r\nProgressions\r\nHave a race that players must perform
    10 total moves (at a different set of cones each time). Only one player can occupy
    a set of cones at a time. \r\nAdaptations\r\nMake the space and number of \u2018defenders\u2019
    (cones) larger or smaller depending on number of players.\r"
