  description: "Detail\r\nField size 12x24yds. In teams 3-6, one team starts attacking
    for 4minutes and then roles are reversed.  Attacker dribbles through the gate
    in the middle 8yds out with the defender running alongside or slightly behind
    but not in front.  The defender cannot take the ball from the attacking player
    until s/he gets through the gate.  Attacker can score on any of the 3 goals but
    gets double for scoring on the ones behind them.  If the defender wins the ball
    they can only score on the goal at the top of the field.  Rotate the teams, so
    as to make it into a tournament. \r\nProgressions\r\nN/A\r\nAdaptations\r\nN/A"
