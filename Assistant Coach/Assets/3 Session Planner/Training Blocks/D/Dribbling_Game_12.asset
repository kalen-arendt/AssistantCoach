  description: "Detail\r\nMake a 15x20 yard grid. Players play 1v1 to two gates. The
    attacker must score by dribbling past the \u20185 yard line\u2019 and pass/dribble
    the ball through the gate. If the defender wins the ball they will try to dribble
    past the end line (where the extra players are waiting). Once the player scores,
    he becomes the defender and defends the next player in line.\r\nProgressions\r\nN/A\r\nAdaptations\r\nMake
    two grids if there are 8 or more players.\r\n"
