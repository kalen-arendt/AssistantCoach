  description: "Detail\r\nFor the first 10 minutes players will be dribbling within
    a 15x15 yard box, coach will tell players different skills/activities to do (U10:
    touch ball with weak foot, 10 toe touches, 10 foundation touches, 10 combination
    U12: touch ball with weak foot, every step a touch, 10 triangles each foot, 10
    stationary scissors U14: touch ball with weak foot, every step a touch, only use
    the sole, 10 juggles alternating feet, 10 triangles). The next 10 minutes split
    group into 4 equal groups. Each group will start on one line of the square. At
    the same time players will all dribble across, get to the line across from the
    line they started on, turn around and go back (continuously).  While this is happening
    coach will yell out different types of turns (inside cut, outside cut, cryuff
    turn) that the players will perform and go back to the line they just came from
    before turning around. \r\nProgressions\r\nN/A\r\nAdaptations\r\nMake grid bigger
    or smaller depending on numbers.\r\n"
