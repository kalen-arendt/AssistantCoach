    shot or scores stays on to defend the two players entering the game from the opposing
    team. If the ball goes out of play, the last person to have touched it stays in
    to defend. If defender wins the ball and scores, or kicks it out of bounds, the
    next two attacking players attack the same defender.\r\nProgressions\r\nPlay 2v2
    to goal, the rotating team will be the one which the ball goes out in their half
    or goal gets scored.  \r\nAdaptations\r\nN/A"
