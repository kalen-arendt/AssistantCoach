  description: "Detail\r\nIn the middle of the field make a channel that is 10 yards
    wide, also create two end zones at the end of the field. All the players will
    start in the middle channel dribbling the ball and performing exercises the coach
    decides on (right foot, left foot, toe touches, different kinds of turns, etc.).
    When the coach yells go, all the players run with the ball into one of the end
    zones. Last player to each end zone does 5 push-ups. \r\nProgressions\r\nAdd a
    defender into each area the players have to run through to get to the end zone.
    If a players ball gets touched or they dribble out of bounds they become the new
    defender.\r\nAdaptations\r\nMake the field wider or narrower depending on the
    number of players.\r\n"
