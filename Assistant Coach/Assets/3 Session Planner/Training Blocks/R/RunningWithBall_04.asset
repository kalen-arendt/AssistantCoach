  description: "Detail\r\nSet up a 20x20\u2019 grid, with a 5x5\u2019 box in the middle.
    Players evenly distributed around the outside of the box. Have 4 players start
    with the ball, run with the ball in to the grid, change direction once they\u2019ve
    entered the middle box and exit out a different side. Players perform a takeover
    with another player on the outside who does not have a ball (ensure that players
    are not passing it to their teammates). \r\nProgressions\r\n1) After 5 minutes,
    players must make a move once they enter the middle grid.\r\n2) After 10 minutes,
    players are now able to pass the ball once they exit the grid. This is to get
    the ball moving quicker and to get players to concentrate on their 1st touch into
    space.\r\n3) For the final 5 minutes, have players intermix colours around the
    grid on every side. With the same number of balls, ensure each colour has at least
    2 balls. When entering the box, players must perform a move, change direction,
    and find a teammate of the same colour.\r\nAdaptations\r\nFor more players, make
    the outside grid bigger.\r\n"
