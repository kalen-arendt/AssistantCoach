Progressions
After skill, have a competition round of how quickly players can complete 20 of that individual skill.

Detail
For the first 10 minutes players will work in their own space working on different Coerver skills (toe touches, foundation touches, combination, left foot triangles, right foot triangles and pull-stop – both directions). For the next ten minutes, players will line up behind cones as shown in picture and will dribble/perform different activities to the cone then turn right (switch to left half way through) and dribble to the next line, the next player in line can start when player gets to the end of the next line (4 players going at a time). Start with dribbling with right foot, then dribbling with left foot, then toe touches to the middle cone, foundation touches to the middle cone, pull stops to the middle cone.

SA_009
Detail
Ladder spacing = 10x10. Players work in pairs. Both players start behind the line with one partner having the ball in their hands and the other ready to receive. Each time they are successful they move up a rung in the ladder. To get 1pt pairs must perform the skill 4 consecutive times (once in each rung of the ladder) alternating the server and the receiver. If they mess up they go back to the beginning and start over but they maintain their pts. Play until a pair gets the target number of pts for that skill. Ie; Kick, Head(receiver), Catch(server). Only 1 pair in a rung of the ladder at a time.
Coaching pts: 
1. Strike ball with laces for service
2. Be on toes so to adjust body position appropriately
3. Judge the flight of the ball first then get body in line with the ball
4. Square body to the target
5. Present surface and cushion the ball
6. Controlled ball should remain in front of the body
Progressions:

Detail
Field size = 10-12x10-12yds. 4-6players to a grid. Defender starts in the middle of the grid and tosses a ball for the attacking player to control, then must touch a cone before they can defend. If defender serves it out of bounds they redo it. Play to small goals.  Game restarts when the ball goes out of bounds.  Both players take a turn being the defender before you switch the pair in the middle.  
Coaching pts: 
1. Watch the ball right into their foot
2. Present the controlling surface then withdraw it to cushion the ball down.
3. While ball is in the air attacker should find the location of the defender.
4. 1st touch away from pressure.
5. Face defender as quickly as possible.
Progressions:
The better they get the higher the toss should go.  
Adaptations
