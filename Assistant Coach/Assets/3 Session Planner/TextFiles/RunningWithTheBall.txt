Running w/ the Ball
--------------------------------------
/============================/
R_01
Detail
Players run with the ball as fast as they can, weave in and out of the cones, then continue running with the ball to opposite end. Once they reach the opposite end, next player will take the ball and do the same. Space should be 40-50 yards long in total. 
Progressions
Have players only use a certain foot or certain parts of their foot when weaving through the middle cones.
Adaptations
If there are 7 or more players, have two rows going at a time. 


/============================/
R_02
Detail
In the middle of the field make a channel that is 10 yards wide, also create two end zones at the end of the field. All the players will start in the middle channel dribbling the ball and performing exercises the coach decides on (right foot, left foot, toe touches, different kinds of turns, etc.). When the coach yells go, all the players run with the ball into one of the end zones. Last player to each end zone does 5 push-ups. 
Progressions
Add a defender into each area the players have to run through to get to the end zone. If a players ball gets touched or they dribble out of bounds they become the new defender.
Adaptations
Make the field wider or narrower depending on the number of players.

/============================/
R_03
Detail
Set up end cones 20 yards apart, with 1 cone in the middle. Have the 3 cones to dribble around, at least 5 yards outside of middle cone. Have players lined up on end cones, with one player in the middle. Player at middle cone checks off and receives a pass from the end player. They play a 1-2, then end player drives into the space towards the set of 3 cones. Players must dribble through these and find the 2nd player in line on the other side. Once 1st player receives the ball back from the middle player, the other side can go. Have the middle player work for 1 minute, then change.
Progressions
Have players dribble through the three cones different ways (ie. outside of feet only, inside of feet only, pull stop, etc.)
Adaptations
For players 10 and up, end cones should be pulled further apart.

/============================/
R_04
Detail
Set up a 20x20’ grid, with a 5x5’ box in the middle. Players evenly distributed around the outside of the box. Have 4 players start with the ball, run with the ball in to the grid, change direction once they’ve entered the middle box and exit out a different side. Players perform a takeover with another player on the outside who does not have a ball (ensure that players are not passing it to their teammates). 
Progressions
1) After 5 minutes, players must make a move once they enter the middle grid.
2) After 10 minutes, players are now able to pass the ball once they exit the grid. This is to get the ball moving quicker and to get players to concentrate on their 1st touch into space.
3) For the final 5 minutes, have players intermix colours around the grid on every side. With the same number of balls, ensure each colour has at least 2 balls. When entering the box, players must perform a move, change direction, and find a teammate of the same colour.
Adaptations
For more players, make the outside grid bigger.

/============================/
R_05
Detail
Set up 1, 20x20 yard box with 1 pole in the middle. For the first 5 minutes, players dribble in towards the middle pole, go to one side, and dribble in to the line across from them. Once players reach the middle of the grid, the other colours start from the opposite corners. Switch directions around the flag after 5 minutes.
Progressions
Players can then start adding in a move to get around the pole. 
Adaptations
Make outside box bigger for older players.

/============================/
R_06
Detail
In a 20x25 yard area players are in teams of 6 and 3 players are behind each line (see diagram). First player with the ball runs with the ball, stops it on the line and does 10 touches. Once skill is complete, next player goes the opposite direction. Team stops when players are back in their original spot.
Progressions
Foundation touches on the line.
Brazilian toe touches on the line.
Have players go back and forth and back again without performing a skill.
Adaptations
Have 3 teams if there are 15 or more players.

/============================/
R_07
Detail
In a 15x25 yard area, set up 4 gates (one in each corner – yellow cones in diagram). Split the group into two and have them stand in the gates diagonal from each other. One player starts by running with the ball and then playing into the gate, as soon as the ball has gone through (or out of bounds), the player in the opposite line starts running with the ball, the player who just scored should go try to defend the gate. Switch sides that players start on half way through.
Progressions
Have a competition, whichever team scores 10 goals first is the winner (every time a player successfully dribbles through a gate it counts as one goal).
Adaptations
Make gates wider for younger age groups. 

/============================/
R_08
Detail
See diagram for set up. First player in line with the ball passes the ball through the gate to the first player in the other line. The receiving player runs with the ball and tries to score a goal. Once the ball goes through the gate, the player that passed it can chase the player with the ball. Switches roles after shot is taken. Switch GK’s every 2-3 minutes. At the 10 minute mark, switch sides so players use both feet to run and shoot the ball.

/============================/
R_09
Detail
1v1 in a 15x20 yard area. Each player is attacking two goals and defending 2 goals (yellow cones). If a goal is scored defending player goes off and a new attacking player comes in (player that scored a goal becomes defender). If ball goes out in your half you are out, and go back into your line. 
Progressions
Play 2v2 with same rules.
Adaptations
If there are 12 or more players, make 2 grids.


/============================/
R_010
Detail
Set up 1, 30x50 box with 2 big goals on each side (can use pugg goals/flags, depending on number of players). Field players can take their turn in goal. Match up every field player with someone on the opposition (try to match up players based on skill level). Players can only defend their partner on the other team in a 1v1 battle. Each team tries to score on the goals. Play restarts from coach.
