Ball Striking
--------------------------------------
/============================/
BS_01
Detail
Players pair up and strike a ball back and forth over incrementally greater distances using proper ball striking technique. Once players are confident, every time their partner is able to control the ball out of the air behind the appropriate set of cones, one point is awarded. Play up to 10 points.
Progressions
Progress from striking a dead ball to striking a moving ball. 
Adaptations
If there is an odd number of players, have a group of 3 and have two of them rotate.

/============================/
BS_02
Detail
Players pick a partner and play in a 6x6 yard box. They strike the ball in the air and try to get the ball to land in the opposite 6x6 (which is 20 yards away). If it enters the grid without a bounce, one of the players in that grid controls the ball for their teammate (in one touch – before the ball touches the ground) and that player knocks it back trying to get it into the 6x6. Game continues until the ball goes out, the team that doesn’t get the ball into the opposite 6x6, gets a point (you don’t want points). Play games of 4-5 minutes. Winning team moves right, losing team moves left (the right most field is where teams should try to get).
Progressions
N/A
Adaptations
Place end zones further apart if 20 yards is becoming too easy.

/============================/
BS_03
Detail
Players line up behind cones (see picture). They need to take maximum 3 touches to get into the opposite box. Once they are in the opposite box they can strike the ball on target. 1 goal = 1 point. Change GK every 2-3 minutes. 
Progressions
Have player in the opposite line chase the ball carrier down to add some pressure on the player shooting the ball.

/============================/
BS_04
Detail
Have equal numbers behind each of the 4 cones. Players on cone ‘1’ start by dribbling up to the two cones, performing a little faint, cutting inside then have a shot. They will then turn around, perform a give and go around the two cones with the player on cone ‘2’ then take a shot. Cone ‘3’ will also be a give and go before the shot, and cone ‘4’ will just dribble up to the two cones, perform a faint, cut inside and shoot (with left foot). Have each player go through each line 3 times. If time permits go a 4th or 5th.

BS_05
Detail
Activity #1: Ball gets played from one line to another (see picture), as that pass happens, player on the base line in front of the cone that has been passed to sprints in between the flags, turns with the ball in one touch and shoots with their second touch. Player that made the first pass will stay in the same line to receive the next ball from the opposite line, player that made the pass into the shooting player will go behind the base line and player who took the shot will grab their ball in go to the back of the passing line. Activity #2: Starts the same as activity #1 but the opposite side player will run in between the poles to turn in one touch and shoot in their second touch (diagonal pass instead of straight pass). Rotation of players will be the same. 
Progressions

/============================/
BS_06
Detail 
One player starts in each of the 5 boxes (4 outside boxes should be 6x6, central box should be 5x5), the rest of the players line up behind the central cones (see picture). Player in the middle box will receive the ball from one of the end players take one touch to turn out one of the sides of the box and then strike a driven ball to the player in the box on that side. Players follow their pass and the player that ends up with the ball goes to the back of the line on the side they were on. 
Progressions
Progress after 10 minutes to turning and striking a diagonal ball in the air to the opposite side box. 
Adaptations
Make the target boxes bigger or smaller depending on skill.
Move the target boxes closer or further away depending on skill.

/============================/
BS_07
Detail
Set up grid as shown (2, 10x20 yard end zones, and a 20x20 central zone). Ball gets played into one of the end zone teams; the central team can send one player in to defend. The end zone team tries to get 3 passes, if they do they can play over (or drive a ball through) to the far team in the opposite end zone. The players in the central zone can try to intercept the ball. If the team successfully transfers the ball from one end zone to the other they get a point. If the defending team wins the ball back, or the ball goes out, the defending team switches with the team in the end zone. 
Progressions
Add a second defending player in to defend.
Adaptations
Make middle zone even bigger (or smaller) depending on age and ability.


/============================/
BS_08
Detail
In a 48x25 yard field, mark out two wide neutral zones that are each 4 yards wide. Play 4v4 in the middle channel with two neutral players who occupy the wide channels (these players have 2 touches). Players can only score off of crosses (in one touch). Switch neutral players every 4-5 minutes.

BS_09
Detail
See diagram for set up. First player in line with the ball passes the ball through the gate to the first player in the other line. The receiving player runs with the ball and tries to score a goal. Once the ball goes through the gate, the player that passed it can chase the player with the ball. Switches roles after shot is taken. Switch GK’s every 2-3 minutes. At the 10 minute mark, switch sides so players use both feet to run and shoot the ball.

BS_010
Detail
In a 22x40 yard space, cut the field in half. In each defending half, play 4v1 (plus a GK). These players must stay in their grid and score from their own half. Defending players on the other team can attempt to block. If the one attacking player wins the ball they can either pass it back into their defending half or try to score. Switch the one defending player in the attacking half every 2 minutes. Keep score. 
Progressions
N/A
Adaptations
Add another defender into each half to apply more pressure.

/============================/
BS_011
Detail
Play 5v5 (or 4v4) in a 25x25 yard box. Have two target players in a 7x7 yard box 15 yards away from the 25x25 yard box (see diagram). Players in the central grid try to get the ball in the air to the player in the same colour as them in the target box. The player in the target box must control the ball in the air, inside the box for their team to get a point. If ball goes out of play, or point is scored, the coach will play another ball into the team that has not played it out. Switch target players every 2-3 minutes.
