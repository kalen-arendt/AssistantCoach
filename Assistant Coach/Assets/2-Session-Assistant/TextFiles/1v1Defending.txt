1v1_01
Detail
Make an 8x15 yard grid. Have players stand on opposite ends of the grid; one side will have the soccer balls (see picture). Player that starts with the ball passes it to the player on the other side of the grid. Then the 2 players go 1v1 until the ball goes out or someone dribbles it past the end line. 
Progressions
Have the player chip the ball into the air to the attacking player.
Add gates that players need to score on.
Adaptations
Depending on # of players you may need to make 2 grids.
