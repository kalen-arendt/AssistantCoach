  description: "Detail\r\nSet up 3, 10x10 yard boxes with a 5-yard neutral zone (number
    the boxes). For the first 10 minutes players will be dribbling in one of the boxes
    performing different skills (U10: dribble with weak foot, 10 combination touches,
    inside cut, outside cut U12: every step a touch, 2 footed inside V, pull back
    U14: 2 footed inside V, pull back, cruyff turn). When the coach shouts out a number
    all the players will have to quickly dribble into that box, last player in the
    box has to do 5 push ups. For the next 10 minutes play the gauntlet. Defenders
    must start on the back of their 10x10 yard grid, and can defend only when the
    attacker enters their grid. If the defender wins the ball they try to dribble
    to the front of their grid for a point. Attackers get a point if they beat all
    3 defenders. Switch defenders every 2-3 minutes. \r\nProgressions\r\nFor the first
    part, add colours to boxes, or switch around the numbers of the boxes to keep
    players thinking.\r\nAdaptations\r\nN/A"
