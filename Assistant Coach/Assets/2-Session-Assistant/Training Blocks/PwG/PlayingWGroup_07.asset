  description: "Detail\r\nField size should be approx. 25x25.\r\nFirst, players are
    divided into two equal teams. One team starts in the middle of the grid. The other
    team that isn\u2019t in the middle is numbered 1- (how many players you have).
    The coach passes the ball into the middle and the player numbered #1 goes in and
    chases. If the team in the middle makes 5 consecutive passes, #2 goes in and helps
    #1 chase. When the defenders win the ball or the ball goes out of bounds reset
    and the next defender goes in and chases. \r\nProgressions\r\nHave defending players
    start on different areas around the box.\r\nAdaptations\r\nMake field bigger or
    smaller depending on number of players.\r\n"
