  description: "Detail\r\nExtend the 18y box to 25y. Place two small gates (in yellow)
    opposite from the full size goal. Have the defenders start on the corner of the
    box and pass the ball to the first attacker. The attacker tries to score in the
    big goal, if the defender wins the ball they try to dribble through one of the
    yellow gates. Players will switch roles after 5 minutes and teams should keep
    score. When they switch the second time defenders should start from the opposite
    side of the box.\r\n\nAdaptations\r\nIf attacking players are shooting right away,
    encourage them to dribble or extend the length of the field.\r\n"
