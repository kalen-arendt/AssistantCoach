  description: "Detail\r\nSet up 2 grids 15\u2019x20\u2019 with a 5\u2019 channel
    in between. 1 team of 5 starts in 1 grid. To start, the coach plays the ball in
    to the attacking team on one side. Once the ball enters the grid, 2 red players
    from the other side press to win the ball back. To score a point, the blue team
    must connect 8 passes. If red wins the ball back, they must pass the ball back
    across the middle channel. Once the ball travels back across the middle channel,
    the red team is now looking to keep possession, blue sends 2 to defend. Every
    player should take a turn to defend. If ball goes out of bounds, the coach plays
    the ball back in.\r\nProgressions\r\nN/A\r\nAdaptations\r\nIf two defenders is
    too difficult, start with just one player defending.\r\n"
