  description: "Detail\r\nSet up a grid, 30\u2019x20\u2019. Ensure each team has 2
    end players on either side of the goal, with 3 players inside the middle grid.
    Ball starts with the coach to either team. To score a point, you must find an
    end player first. Change end players every 2 minutes. Progressions\r\nMake players
    complete a certain number of passes before they can score a goal.\r\nAdaptations\r\nDepending
    on numbers, either add a neutral or play 4v4 in the middle.\r\n"
