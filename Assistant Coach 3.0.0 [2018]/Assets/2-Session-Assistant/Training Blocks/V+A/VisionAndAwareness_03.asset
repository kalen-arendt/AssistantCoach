  description: "Detail\r\n3 colors in a 12x12 yard box, one touch passing in the box.
    Once a player plays the ball they must go around a cone and get back in (can\u2019t
    go around the same cone twice).\r\nProgressions\r\nStart with passing to anyone,
    then pass to someone in a different color, then use sequences (ie. blue, red,
    yellow). \r\nAdaptations\r\nMake the space bigger if there are more players than
    9 in the grid.\r\n"
