  description: "Detail\r\nPlayers will perform a move (scissors, sole role, 2 footed
    outside foot V) at the yellow cone, then dribble through the red cones, perform
    another move at the yellow cone, turn around the last red cone and then run back
    with the ball to the start. Second player can start when the first player gets
    to the end of the tight dribbling section. \r\nProgressions\r\nAdd restrictions
    to how players can dribble through the cones (ie. Only left foot, only using outsides
    of the feet, etc.).\r\nAdaptations\r\nMake enough lines so that there are only
    3 or 4 players per line.\r"
