  description: "Detail\r\nUse the width of the box and 25 yards from the touch line.
    Defending players start by the net with some soccer balls. Attacking players start
    on a diagonal to them without a ball (see picture). Defending player passes the
    ball out to the attacking player and then goes to win the ball. Attacking player
    tries to score. If defending player wins the ball, they dribble through one of
    the yellow gates for a point.\r\nProgressions\r\nTo make it more difficult defending
    player can chip the ball into the attacking player so they need to have a better
    first touch. Adaptations\r\nN/A"
