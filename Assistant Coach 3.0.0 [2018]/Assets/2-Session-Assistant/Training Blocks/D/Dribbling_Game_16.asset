  description: "Detail\r\nSet up a 10\u2019x10\u2019\u2019 grid. Two or three players
    are selected as the Dogs, and they stand in the corner of the coned area. All
    remaining players have a ball each anywhere in the area. The aim of the game is
    to protect your ball and keep possession without being tackled by the Dogs. When
    a player is tackled and their ball has been kicked out of the area, they collect
    their ball and wait on the outside of the area. The winner is the last player
    to become a Dog. Continuous practice.\r\nThe last 3 people to be tackled can start
    as dogs in the next round.\r\nProgressions\r\nN/A\r\nAdaptations\r\nIf you have
    more players, make the grid bigger.\r\n"
