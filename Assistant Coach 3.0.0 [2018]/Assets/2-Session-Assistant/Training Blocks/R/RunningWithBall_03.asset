  description: "Detail\r\nSet up end cones 20 yards apart, with 1 cone in the middle.
    Have the 3 cones to dribble around, at least 5 yards outside of middle cone. Have
    players lined up on end cones, with one player in the middle. Player at middle
    cone checks off and receives a pass from the end player. They play a 1-2, then
    end player drives into the space towards the set of 3 cones. Players must dribble
    through these and find the 2nd player in line on the other side. Once 1st player
    receives the ball back from the middle player, the other side can go. Have the
    middle player work for 1 minute, then change.\r\nProgressions\r\nHave players
    dribble through the three cones different ways (ie. outside of feet only, inside
    of feet only, pull stop, etc.)\r\nAdaptations\r\nFor players 10 and up, end cones
    should be pulled further apart.\r\n"
