  description: "Detail\r\nPlayers pair up and strike a ball back and forth over incrementally
    greater distances using proper ball striking technique. Once players are confident,
    every time their partner is able to control the ball out of the air behind the
    appropriate set of cones, one point is awarded. Play up to 10 points.\r\nProgressions\r\nProgress
    from striking a dead ball to striking a moving ball. \r\n\nIf there is an odd
    number of players, have a group of 3 and have two of them rotate.\r\n"
