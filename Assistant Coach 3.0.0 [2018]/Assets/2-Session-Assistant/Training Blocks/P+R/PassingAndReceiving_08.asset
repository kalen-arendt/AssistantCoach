  description: "Detail\r\nStart by having one player stand by each cone; remaining
    players form a line behind the cone that is the base of the \u201CY\u201D (players
    behind this cone need a ball). Players pass the ball in the correct sequence (see
    picture) and move onto the next cone once they complete their pass/passes. *Note*
    Drill #1 should be ran before drill #2 is attempted.\r\nProgressions\r\nSee above.\r\nAdaptations\r\nMake
    two grids if you have 12 or more players.\r\n"
