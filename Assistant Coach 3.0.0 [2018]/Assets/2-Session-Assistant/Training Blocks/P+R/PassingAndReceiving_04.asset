  description: "Detail\r\nIn an 8x8 yard grid, 4 players will occupy one line (they
    can only move on the line from side to side). Players pass a ball around, moving
    according to who has the ball. The ball can\u2019t be passed across the grid,
    only from one side to another.\r\nProgressions\r\nTo make it harder, limit the
    amount of touches a player can take (2 touches). \r\nAdaptations\r\nIf there are
    some players sitting, switch them in after 1 minute (intensity should be high)!
    If there are 8 or more players make 2 grids.\r\n"
