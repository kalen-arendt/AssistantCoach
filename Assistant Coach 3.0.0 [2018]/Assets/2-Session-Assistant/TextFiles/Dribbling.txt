DRIBBLING
--------------------------------------
/============================/
D_01
Detail
First player in each line runs to the first ball, dribbles across, stops the ball and runs to the next ball and dribbles across again. 2nd player in each line can start once the first players start dribbling the second ball. 
Progressions
Once players are comfortable they can do a move in the middle (scissors, donut, pull push, etc.)

/============================/
D_02
Detail
In a 20x25 yard box place 3 cones beside each other at random (see picture). These cones act as a defender.  Players will dribble around the box and when reaching a row of cones will perform the desired move (inside cut, outside cut, step over). 
Progressions
Have a race that players must perform 10 total moves (at a different set of cones each time). Only one player can occupy a set of cones at a time. 
Adaptations
Make the space and number of ‘defenders’ (cones) larger or smaller depending on number of players.


/============================/
D_03
Detail
Players will perform a move (scissors, sole role, 2 footed outside foot V) at the yellow cone, then dribble through the red cones, perform another move at the yellow cone, turn around the last red cone and then run back with the ball to the start. Second player can start when the first player gets to the end of the tight dribbling section. 
Progressions
Add restrictions to how players can dribble through the cones (ie. Only left foot, only using outsides of the feet, etc.).
Adaptations
Make enough lines so that there are only 3 or 4 players per line.

/============================/
D_04
Detail
Using a centre circle (or just cones), and players will line up around the circle. Players start to dribble around the circle. 
Progressions
Have players use different parts of their foot (inside and outside)
Have players change directions
Have players dribble in and out of the cones
Adaptations
For a large amount of players make the size of the circle bigger

/============================/
D_05
Detail
For the first 10 minutes players will be dribbling within a 15x15 yard box, coach will tell players different skills/activities to do (U10: touch ball with weak foot, 10 toe touches, 10 foundation touches, 10 combination U12: touch ball with weak foot, every step a touch, 10 triangles each foot, 10 stationary scissors U14: touch ball with weak foot, every step a touch, only use the sole, 10 juggles alternating feet, 10 triangles). The next 10 minutes split group into 4 equal groups. Each group will start on one line of the square. At the same time players will all dribble across, get to the line across from the line they started on, turn around and go back (continuously).  While this is happening coach will yell out different types of turns (inside cut, outside cut, cryuff turn) that the players will perform and go back to the line they just came from before turning around. 
Progressions

Adaptations
Make grid bigger or smaller depending on numbers.

/============================/
D_06
Detail
Set up 3, 10x10 yard boxes with a 5-yard neutral zone (number the boxes). For the first 10 minutes players will be dribbling in one of the boxes performing different skills (U10: dribble with weak foot, 10 combination touches, inside cut, outside cut U12: every step a touch, 2 footed inside V, pull back U14: 2 footed inside V, pull back, cruyff turn). When the coach shouts out a number all the players will have to quickly dribble into that box, last player in the box has to do 5 push ups. For the next 10 minutes play the gauntlet. Defenders must start on the back of their 10x10 yard grid, and can defend only when the attacker enters their grid. If the defender wins the ball they try to dribble to the front of their grid for a point. Attackers get a point if they beat all 3 defenders. Switch defenders every 2-3 minutes. 
Progressions
For the first part, add colours to boxes, or switch around the numbers of the boxes to keep players thinking.

D_07
Detail

D_09
Detail
Set up a 15’x15’ square grid. Have 5 – 2’ gates in the middle of the square. Every player starts with a ball and looks to dribble around inside the area. 
Progressions
Players can only use a certain foot.
Players can only use a certain part of their foot.
Players must do a figure 8 around the cones. 
Adaptations
Make the grid bigger, and have more gates depending on numbers.

D_10
Detail
Set up a field that is 15’x15’. Players are in teams of 2, 3 or 4. Place all balls in the middle circle. When the coach says GO the players race to bring all of the balls to their corner by dribbling. The game ends when all balls are gone from the middle. The team with the most balls in their area, wins. 
Progressions
Before the next player can go, have the player do 5 toe touches or 5 foundation touches.

D_11
Detail
In a 20x20 yard grid, players dribble around in a grid with red and yellow cones on the ground. Coach can call out moves and players need to perform them. If a coach calls out a colour the players must go to an open cone of that colour.
Progressions

/============================/
D_012
Detail
Make a 15x20 yard grid. Players play 1v1 to two gates. The attacker must score by dribbling past the ‘5 yard line’ and pass/dribble the ball through the gate. If the defender wins the ball they will try to dribble past the end line (where the extra players are waiting). Once the player scores, he becomes the defender and defends the next player in line.
Progressions
N/A
Adaptations
Make two grids if there are 8 or more players.

/============================/
D_013
Detail
Use the width of the box and 25 yards from the touch line. Defending players start by the net with some soccer balls. Attacking players start on a diagonal to them without a ball (see picture). Defending player passes the ball out to the attacking player and then goes to win the ball. Attacking player tries to score. If defending player wins the ball, they dribble through one of the yellow gates for a point.
Progressions
To make it more difficult defending player can chip the ball into the attacking player so they need to have a better first touch. Adaptations

/============================/
D_014
Detail
In a 25x25 yard grid, set up 3 mini goals at random. Coach will play a ball into the grid and the first two players in line will battle for the ball. Player in possession tries to score, player without the ball tries to win the ball and score.
Progressions

/============================/
D_015
Detail
In a 20x20 yard area place two gates and two goals (as shown in picture). Teams line up across opposite ends. Coach plays a ball into the middle. First player that wins the ball dribbles through one of the two gates. Whichever colour gate they dribble through they must score in the corresponding colour goal.
Progressions
Play 2v2
Adaptations
If too difficult, start with dribble through a gate and score in any goal. Then progress to corresponding gates and goals.

/============================/
D_016
Detail
Set up a 10’x10’’ grid. Two or three players are selected as the Dogs, and they stand in the corner of the coned area. All remaining players have a ball each anywhere in the area. The aim of the game is to protect your ball and keep possession without being tackled by the Dogs. When a player is tackled and their ball has been kicked out of the area, they collect their ball and wait on the outside of the area. The winner is the last player to become a Dog. Continuous practice.
The last 3 people to be tackled can start as dogs in the next round.
Progressions
N/A
Adaptations
If you have more players, make the grid bigger.

/============================/
D_017
Detail
In a 12x30 yard space, players line up across from each other (see diagram). One line has balls, the other doesn’t, player with the ball passes across and then that player tries to dribble through one of the gates. The player that passed the ball tries to defend. If the defender wins the ball they try to dribble through one of the gates. If ball goes out or goal is scored, players switch lines. Progressions
If players are doing well, let them score in the gate across from them for 2 points and the side goals for one point.

D_018
Detail
Field size 12x24yds. In teams 3-6, one team starts attacking for 4minutes and then roles are reversed.  Attacker dribbles through the gate in the middle 8yds out with the defender running alongside or slightly behind but not in front.  The defender cannot take the ball from the attacking player until s/he gets through the gate.  Attacker can score on any of the 3 goals but gets double for scoring on the ones behind them.  If the defender wins the ball they can only score on the goal at the top of the field.  Rotate the teams, so as to make it into a tournament.
