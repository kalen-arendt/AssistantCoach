V+A_01
Detail
Cones should be 20 yards apart. Start off by having one player on every cone (need a ball) and one player in the middle of every cone (see picture). Players on the cone need to have one yellow cone and one red cone in opposite hands. Player in the middle asks for the ball from one end, while this is happening, the player on the opposite end raises one of the cones. Before the player in the middle receives the ball they need to check their shoulder and see what cone is being held up (they should then yell out the colour). Player then receives the ball and with their first touch plays around that colour cone (see picture), and then passes it back to the player. Then the player in the middle will turn and do the same thing to the player on the opposite side. (Players will do this for 1 min then switch; each player should be in the middle twice).
Progressions
If a red cone is held up, player in the middle bounces the ball back in one touch. If yellow is held up, player in the middle turns and plays out the other side.
Adaptations
If there is a group of 4, have the players rotate.

V+A_02
Detail
Players check to the ball then step out to open up one side or the other. They return the ball to the passer. Part 2: Player at the far end holds up a hand and that is the side the player must open up to. Part 3: Player at far end holds up a hand with a fist or a 5. If fist play back, if 5 turn and dribble/pass. Player at far end collects and dribble then passes to start the sequence over. Make sure to rotate the server. 
Progressions
See diagram.

V+A_03
Detail
3 colors in a 12x12 yard box, one touch passing in the box. Once a player plays the ball they must go around a cone and get back in (can’t go around the same cone twice).
Progressions
Start with passing to anyone, then pass to someone in a different color, then use sequences (ie. blue, red, yellow). 
Adaptations
Make the space bigger if there are more players than 9 in the grid.

V+A_04
Detail
Field: 32Lx16W 4-4min games. Players play 1v1 to goal. Game begins with player checking to the ball and looking over their shoulder to identify where the pressure is coming from. They will receive and play 1v1 to goal. Defenders go when coach signals by holding up a coloured cone. Coach should signal as attacker checks. Defender from the appropriate line presses.

V+A_06
Detail
Each team has a player in the end zone that they are looking to score in. Coach plays ball in. Team in possession looks to find their target player in the end zone, who then needs to play in one touch to a teammate making a run into the zone. If team can find Switch target player every 2 minutes. 
Progressions
After 10 minutes, teams can look to either dribble into end zone, or connect with target player as before.
