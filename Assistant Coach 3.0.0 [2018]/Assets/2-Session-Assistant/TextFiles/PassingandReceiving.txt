Passing & Receiving
--------------------------------------
/============================/
P+R_01
Detail
See diagram for set up. All gates should be 3 yards wide and should be 15 yards apart from each other. Player in the middle will receive from one of the sides, receive with the inside of their back foot and then on their second touch play to the player at the top, who will receive with the outside of their foot, who will then play back to the line that the ball came from. Players follow their pass and then the next pass starts with the opposite line with the same sequence. 
Progressions
Switch the surface players will receive with.
Make gates further apart.
Adaptations
N/A

/============================/
P+R_02
Detail
Diagram 1
Players pass across and then apply some pressure after their pass, player receiving the pass must take a clean first touch out of their feet, play across in their second pass and apply some pressure.
Diagram 2
Player checks in, receives the ball with their back foot and passes the ball to the next player in line with their second touch. 
Progressions
In diagram two, have player on the end either hold their hand up or leave it down. Player receiving the ball must call out up or down prior to receiving. This has them shoulder check prior to receiving the pass.
Adaptations
Make two grids if you have 8 or more players. 

/============================/
P+R_03
Detail
#1. Players will pass the ball through the gate (follow the pass) to a teammate, who will then play around the gate in one touch. They will then dribble to the end of the opposite line.
#2. Players will pass the ball through the gate (follow the pass) to a teammate, who will then play around the gate in one touch. They then play the ball to the next player in line, who is behind the opposite gate (follow the pass). 
Progressions
Change the surface in which players take their first touch with (ie. Inside of foot or outside of foot).
Adaptations
Make 2 lines if there are 10 or more players.

/============================/
P+R_04
Detail
In an 8x8 yard grid, 4 players will occupy one line (they can only move on the line from side to side). Players pass a ball around, moving according to who has the ball. The ball can’t be passed across the grid, only from one side to another.
Progressions
To make it harder, limit the amount of touches a player can take (2 touches). 
Adaptations
If there are some players sitting, switch them in after 1 minute (intensity should be high)! If there are 8 or more players make 2 grids.

/============================/
P+R_05
Detail
Set out cones in same shape as photo, 5’ apart. Set up multiple grids depending on the number of players (5 sets for 10 players). Have 1 player behind the gate, and 1 player behind the single cone. Player at the single cone passes the ball through the gate for the player on the other side to take a touch around the cone and pass back to the player at the single cone.
Progressions
Inside touch, pass back with the same foot.
Inside touch across body, pass back with opposite foot.
Outside touch, pass back with same foot.
Adaptations
Place cones further apart depending on skill.

/============================/
P+R_06
Detail
Set up around the centre circle of a field, or lay cones out in a circle, 10’ in diameter. Place 5 (or 6) players in 1 colour bib and 5 (or 6) players in a different colour. Players in 1 colour spread out around the circle. The other team spreads out in the middle of the circle with a ball. Players inside the circle dribble around and follow the progressions shown in the picture:
 
1. Pass to outside player, and switch 
2. Pass to outside player, open up, and receive the ball back
3. Pass to outside player, player to the right of that player who just received it finds the ball in the middle (3rd man run)

/============================/
P+R_07
Detail
Set up cones 10’ apart, as shown in photo. Set up poles 4’ outside of the middle, in a diamond shape. Have 1 player start on the pole, and more players at the end cones. Follow the passing pattern by starting with the ball on the cone. The player on the pole checks away, checks back to the ball and receives a pass to play the next player in line. After a few minutes, change direction and then add in the give and go around the pole. Players always follow their pass.
Progressions
N/A
Adaptations
Move end cones further away depending on age and ability.

/============================/
P+R_08
Detail
Start by having one player stand by each cone; remaining players form a line behind the cone that is the base of the “Y” (players behind this cone need a ball). Players pass the ball in the correct sequence (see picture) and move onto the next cone once they complete their pass/passes. *Note* Drill #1 should be ran before drill #2 is attempted.
Progressions
See above.
Adaptations
Make two grids if you have 12 or more players.

/============================/
P+R_09
Detail
Set up poles in a triangle and poles are 12-14 yards apart. Place a cone 3 yards in behind each pole for players to line up on. For the first exercise players will just pass and follow their pass. 
Progressions
Pass, but run the opposite way of the pass. 
Do a give and go around the pole.
Adaptations
N/A

/============================/
P+R_010
Detail
Set up a grid, 30’x20’. Ensure each team has 2 end players on either side of the goal, with 3 players inside the middle grid. Ball starts with the coach to either team. To score a point, you must find an end player first. Change end players every 2 minutes. Progressions
Make players complete a certain number of passes before they can score a goal.
Adaptations
Depending on numbers, either add a neutral or play 4v4 in the middle.

/============================/
P+R_011
Detail
In a 25x30 yard grid, 2 teams play to 2 neutral targets (defend and attack the same target players). Getting it from target player to target player = 1 point. 
Progressions
Limit touches as a restriction. 
Adaptations
Make the playing space bigger or smaller depending on number of players.


/============================/
P+R_012
Detail
In a 20x30 yard field, play 3v3+1 to two mini goals.
Progressions
N/A
Adaptations
If you have two games going at once, switch teams around and make a tournament.


/============================/
P+R_013
Detail
Set up 2 grids 15’x20’ with a 5’ channel in between. 1 team of 5 starts in 1 grid. To start, the coach plays the ball in to the attacking team on one side. Once the ball enters the grid, 2 red players from the other side press to win the ball back. To score a point, the blue team must connect 8 passes. If red wins the ball back, they must pass the ball back across the middle channel. Once the ball travels back across the middle channel, the red team is now looking to keep possession, blue sends 2 to defend. Every player should take a turn to defend. If ball goes out of bounds, the coach plays the ball back in.
Progressions
N/A
Adaptations
If two defenders is too difficult, start with just one player defending.

/============================/
P+R_014
Detail
Set up cones 20’ apart, as shown in photo. 2 teams of 5. 4 players line up on the outside of the square as target players. 3 players from each team start inside the square. The objective for each team is to connect 10 passes. Teams can use any of the target players on the outside of the grid. If ball goes out of the grid off of one team, coach plays new ball in to the other team. Switch outside players every 3 minutes.
Progressions
Teams play one direction to their targets. Set up target players from one team across the grid from each other. Teams score a point when they connect from one side of the grid to the other. 
Adaptations
If there are more than 10 players, make the grid bigger and have it 4v4 in the inside.

/============================/
P+R_015
Detail
Field size should be approx. 25x25.
First, players are divided into two equal teams. One team starts in the middle of the grid. The other team that isn’t in the middle is numbered 1- (how many players you have). The coach passes the ball into the middle and the player numbered #1 goes in and chases. If the team in the middle makes 5 consecutive passes, #2 goes in and helps #1 chase. When the defenders win the ball or the ball goes out of bounds reset and the next defender goes in and chases. 
Progressions
Have defending players start on different areas around the box.
Adaptations
Make field bigger or smaller depending on number of players.
